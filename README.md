## Brief / Thoughts while completing project

It's been a little over a year since I've actively coded with Frontendmentor. I really enjoyed how precise seniors would look at your code and give honest, real world answers.

## Summary

After receiving feedback from a project I did earlier, I wanted to implement the improvements on something easier to fix fundamental issues I can improve on

## Technology I used

- HTML
- CSS (No framework)

## Questions I have

- How could I use aria labels more? (If applicable)
- Are my class names correct?
- I avoided using position absolute by using relative instead, as I learnt it still keeps content in the document flow

Please feel free to give any more feedback! Thanks
